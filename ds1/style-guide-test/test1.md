Notify objects are COM objects that exist within dynamic-link libraries (DLLs). These DLLs act as COM *component servers*. Each type of network component has a *class installer* that installs specific types of network components and registers COM *class objects* owned by these network components. Once the main installation phase for network components finishes, the objects get registered. The class installer registers a COM class object by calling the object's DLL entry-point function.

Software-based reset options, shown in the following table, are available on all Windows 10, version 1809 MBB devices. OEM partners can disable or configure these options.

To ensure compatibility with existing modems, each executor uses information from a UICC card in a single slot. Slot mapping defines the association between executors and slots, mapping each executor to one slot.

The network blocks the service because of an expired subscription or another reason.
